## tasks

generate 10 questions for this position

be very specific in these question and refer concrete details from the file 

analyze the file and also generate questions that address gaps in the file compared to the role description 

make sure that the file content is relevant for the role description. if not the case, simply reply with "candidate irrelevant" 

---

# verify the consistency

review your questions one by one by printing them out, then verify they are consistent with the file contents and the role 

make sure that questions are derived from the role description, meaning they focus on what is explicitly required

avoid mentioning irrelevant points from the file content that are not present in the role description 
avoid making mistakes

avoid making things up, it is very dangerous to ask a question that contradict the file content 
use a schema as bulletpoints: 

- question
- purpose of the question
- mini quote file content 
- mini quote role description

---


# verify once again 

refine questions, ensuring they comply with my instructions  
focus on the requirements of the role description
validate consistency of the questions with the provided information 
output only the list of refined questions 
avoid any comments at the beginning or the end of your message

# assess candidate answers 

now, i will present you with a number followed by some text 
number indicates the question you just created
text is a quick note of the answer of the person that i am taking during the conversation 
routine   
- repeat your question 
- rewrite the answer in a more coherent way without adding new meaning and stay close to the answer 
- assess the answer on the terms of 
    - factual correctness - search the web if necessary 
    - completeness - did the applicant miss something important 
    - relevance - does it correspond to what was being asked
    - application - if relevant, does the answer consider real-world implications or applications 
    - evidence: did the applicant cite relevant sources or provide examples to support their points 
- give your verdict about the assessment of the answer 
    - decide pass / no pass 
    - short explanation 
- propose a follow-up question 
    - to dig deeper on the same topic, or
    - to explore tangential topics 
    - alternatively, change topics completely 
- if faced with a new question as indicated either by a number at the beginning or a double question mark like this ??, you should restart the cycle like this
    - forget about the previous question 
    - repeat the routine 
    - special clause: if some later information is relevant to your assessment, remind me about it 
next
- analyze these instructions 
- write a very brief summary of what you are going to do 
- send a message stating you understood 
- wait for my input
